          Hair loss and thinning can arise from various factors, with
          nutritional deficiencies being a significant contributor. Essential
          nutrients for healthy hair growth include iron, zinc, biotin, vitamins
          D, A, E, and C, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids. For instance, iron
          deficiency can weaken hair follicles, while inadequate zinc may lead
